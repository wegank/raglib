TODO: 
- comment inputs/ouputs of all functions
- secure the use of MSolve package
- management of overlapping intervals should be done inside msolve
  (see ComputeBoundsRegular and ComputeBoundsSingular)
- FindGenericLine can be made significantly more efficient (especially
  in the singular case)
- implement early termination for detecting the emptiness of the
  semi-algebraic set under study
- better choices of constraints in the incremental solving procedure
